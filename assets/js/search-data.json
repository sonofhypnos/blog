The only thing that strikes me as different from the plot on CS students, is the number of private schools and that they are doing pretty well on this metric. This makes sense to me as the schools as well as students have stronger incentives to make the student graduate early . To get some comparisons I also looked at business administration students as it is the most popular subject in Germany. Thus classes should be big enough that I shouldn&#39;t have to worry about statistical significance too much . ba_sorted = ba[ba[&#39;students&#39;] &gt; 1000][ba[&#39;ba_time&#39;]&gt;0].sort_values(&#39;ba_time&#39;, axis=0) ba_sorted.ba_time.plot.barh(figsize=(12,12)) plt.xlabel(&quot;% finished after (x + 2) semesters&quot;) plt.title(&quot;Percent of Business Administration students finished after 8 semesters by university&quot;) plt.savefig(&quot;ba_sorted_ba_time.png&quot;) . /tmp/ipykernel_944076/407855156.py:1: UserWarning: Boolean Series key will be reindexed to match DataFrame index. ba_sorted = ba[ba[&#39;students&#39;] &gt; 1000][ba[&#39;ba_time&#39;]&gt;0].sort_values(&#39;ba_time&#39;, axis=0) . sns.scatterplot(x=cs.students, y=cs.ba_time) plt.title(&#39;CS graduates in &quot;reasonable&quot; time (3+1=4 years)&#39;) plt.savefig(&quot;ba_cs_scatter.png&quot;) . Not sure how to interpret this. It makes sense that there is more variation for smaller universities and I think it makes it slightly more likely a lot of this can be explained through a combination of selection effects and variation in student ability. . sns.scatterplot(x=ba.students, y=ba.ba_time) plt.title(&#39;BA graduates in &quot;reasonable&quot; time (3+1=4 years)&#39;) plt.savefig(&quot;ba_ba_scatter.png&quot;) .

            "content": "So most of the time when I make predictions, I&#39;ll spend a couple of minutes trying to come up with relevant reference classes. If it feels tractable, I&#39;ll try to guestimate answers to the sub-questions. But the following question: &quot;By date_X, will the S&amp;P 500 fall below Index_Y?&quot; was quite hard to answer this way. Since it&#39;s asked every month on Almanis, I made this notebook. Feel free to download it for your own predictions. Here is a link to the S&amp;P 500 CSV-file which I downloaded from Yahoo Finance. . For this example, I will ask the question: &quot;Will the S&amp;P 500 go above 3800 by March 1st, 2021?&quot; . To answer whether the S&amp;P 500 will exceed a certain index, I looked at the difference between the current index (3,714.7) and the index that we want to know the probability of exceedance for (3800). I computed this probability by looking at the frequency at which the index has moved by that much in the past12. . For this example, I will ask the question: &quot;Will the S&amp;P 500 go above 3800 by March 1st, 2021?&quot; . To answer the question of whether the S&amp;P 500 will exceed a certain index, I looked at the difference between the current index (3,714.7) and the index that we want to know the probability of exceedance for (3800). I computed this probability by looking at the frequency at which the index has moved by that much in the past12. . import numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns import statsmodels.graphics as stg #we are going to use this later on to check our timeseries for autocorrelation import statsmodels.api as sm %matplotlib inline df = pd.read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sonofhypnos/projects/master/_notebooks/%5EGSPC.csv&quot;) . days_ahead = 30 # the number of days that the S&amp;P has to stay within the boundary boundary = 3800 . So before we can answer our initial question, we need to take a look at our data. . df.head() . Date Open High Low Close Adj Close Volume . 0 1927-12-30 | 17.660000 | 17.660000 | 17.660000 | 17.660000 | 17.660000 | 0 | . 1 1928-01-03 | 17.760000 | 17.760000 | 17.760000 | 17.760000 | 17.760000 | 0 | . 2 1928-01-04 | 17.719999 | 17.719999 | 17.719999 | 17.719999 | 17.719999 | 0 | . 3 1928-01-05 | 17.549999 | 17.549999 | 17.549999 | 17.549999 | 17.549999 | 0 | . 4 1928-01-06 | 17.660000 | 17.660000 | 17.660000 | 17.660000 | 17.660000 | 0 | . As you can see this dataset goes back until 1927. Another thing to notice here is that we only have data for the S&amp;P 500 on business days. Since this is only supposed to be a rough forecast, I am going to ignore this fact and just pretend that the difference between Fridays and Mondays will be the same as between Tuesdays and Wednesdays. But we will still have to keep this fact in mind, so that our forecast also only includes workdays. . sp = df.Close sp.index = pd.to_datetime(df.Date) . sp.head() . Date 1927-12-30 17.660000 1928-01-03 17.760000 1928-01-04 17.719999 1928-01-05 17.549999 1928-01-06 17.660000 Name: Close, dtype: float64 . Let&#39;s take a first look at our timeseries . sns.lineplot(x=sp.index, y=sp.values); . As you can see the graph is growing exponentially. This is even more clear on a log scale: . sns.lineplot(x=sp.index, y=sp.values) plt.yscale(&quot;log&quot;) . We now take a closer look at the correlation in our graph. If this was a (biased) random walk, then there shouldn&#39;t be any (auto-)correlation between price changes3. This is indeed what we see: . pricechange = sp - sp.shift() stg.tsaplots.plot_acf(pricechange[1:]) plt.show() . The following function computes the relative difference between different days in the past. . def relative_shift_n(ts, n): ts_shift = [] for i in range(1,n+1): ts_shift.append((ts - ts.shift(periods=i))/ts) return ts_shift . Now we compute the number of workdays ahead for our forecast . current_weekday = sp[-1:].index.weekday[0] + 1 for i in range(days_ahead): if (current_weekday % 7) &lt; 5: n += 1 current_weekday += 1 print(&quot;workdays ahead:&quot;, n) . workdays ahead: 104 . sp_shift = relative_shift_n(sp, n) shift_index = [str(x) for x in range(1,n+1)] sp_shift = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(dict(zip(shift_index,sp_shift))) sp_shift = sp_shift[n:] #removing NaN entries . sp_shift is an array of price-changes for different intervalls. The title of each column corresponds to the number of days between which the price change was computed. . sp_shift . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 .

The following function finally computes the probability of this happening. . sp_forecast = float(sp[-1:]) + sp_shift * float(sp[-1:]) beyond_boundary = [] #change beyond boundary list based on whether our boundry is #above or below the current index of the S&amp;P 500 if float(sp[-1:]) &lt; boundary: print(&quot;probability of going above boundary:&quot;) for i in range(len(sp_forecast)): beyond_boundary.append(any(sp_forecast.iloc[i] &gt; boundary)) else: print(&quot;probability of going below boundary:&quot;) for i in range(len(sp_forecast)): beyond_boundary.append(any(sp_forecast.iloc[i] &lt; boundary)) beyond_boundary = pd.Series(beyond_boundary) print(beyond_boundary.mean()) beyond_boundary.rolling(window=365).mean().plot() axes = plt.gca() axes.set_ylim([0,1]) plt.show() . probability of going above boundary: 0.8876573441594707 . As we can see, there is some variation. But the rolling average stays in the 70-100% range most of the time. So if the current forecast at Almanis would be at 60%, we could place a relatively confident bet on &quot;YES&quot;. Since we assume the other Almanis participants value their time enough to not make an even more sophisticated model. We also don&#39;t expect them to have information about the direction the market is going. If they did, they could make a fortune shorting or buying the S&amp;P 500 instead. . 1. To be precise, I computed the size of the gap between the current index and the boundary index (3900) as a percentage of the absolute index. I then looked at how often such a big gap had been exceeded in the past in the same number of days.↩ . 2. I considered learning how to do fancy things like volatility forecasting. But when I looked into it, it didn’t feel super exciting. And doing it just for the 8$ dollars I’d be winning on Almanis would be working for less than minimum wage, so I didn’t do it.↩ . 3. If you want to learn more about this, I can recommend datacamps course on time-series. There are also great free resources out there.↩ .",
